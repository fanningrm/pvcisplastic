                            A water main break in Afton Friday, which resulted in loss of water for 24 hours, left a few Afton residents upset. Approximately 70 feet of pipe was replaced by the Public Works Authority which worked around the clock to fix the problem.  [Mayor and chairman of Public Works Authority Billy Mack] Harrison mentioned the water pipes have been in the ground for 30 years which could also be a factor in the break.  “It’s the first major break we’ve had,” Harrison said. “We’ve never gone without water like that before. We’ve had breaks, and you can usually isolate an area and give some people water. This was close enough to the plant tower that we couldn’t get water to anybody.”

                            Crews worked Monday to repair a water main break that caused a 20-foot-wide, 15-foot-deep hole along busy Ventura Boulevard.  The 20-inch plastic pipe, which sits inside an older steel pipe, ruptured Saturday night about 7 p.m. along the 12900 block of Ventura Boulevard at Coldwater Canyon in Studio City, according to KNX 1070’s Jon Baird.  According to the DWP, the massive hole is not a sinkhole, but rather a hole where crews are working on repairs.

                            A water main broke and created a sinkhole in El Cajon Sunday. The break occurred on Ridge Hill Road near the El Cajon neighborhood of Blossom Valley around 2:20 p.m. Along with the sinkhole, the break caused a portion of the road to buckle and crack. “All of a sudden – a gush of water running over our road. It kept flowing for 45 minutes until they came and shut it off,” said Farrah Askins, whose property is next to the road. Officials with the Padre Dam Water District said it was a 16 inch plastic pipe that split open.

The pipes are made of plastic, and tend to dry and crack over the winter.”

But the system has already had 39 recorded breaks since it debuted, which appears inconsistent with the promise of a high-quality and durable pipeline network.

City councilors and Ortega expressed concerns about history repeating itself, because Abengoa operations were damaging to the city referencing a document that showed while in operation, Abengoa used a million gallons of water per day, more than any of the other local industries combined and put water into the city's water sewage treatment system that was so hot, it melted the PVC pipe. The water also had so many pollutants that it contributed to the wear of the city's current waste water treatment plant.

                            Oakwood Country Club hopes to save a lot of water this year, with the replacement of the golf course's irrigation system, which was finished in the early '80s. There were many leaks in the three decade-old PVC pipe system, according to General Manager David North.

And they do what's called straight-piping: some PVC pipe runs every drain (sink, shower, tub, washing machine, and toilet) straight into the creek.

                            Three water main breaks hit Lake Monticello simultaneously on Friday, leaving some residents and businesses without water for 10 hours. Tim Castillo, operations manager for Aqua Virginia, said that the PVC pipe at the Bridlewood main break was laying on bare rock rather than being propertly bedded in gravel. Without that bedding the pipes themselves take the brunt of any shift and can break.

                            Here are new details about the water main break in the 4600 block of Beach Avenue: The broken pipe is an 8-inch diameter plastic (PVC)pipe, constructed in the 1980s. Lincoln City City Engineer Stephanie Reid said the break was caused by a 8-foot long lonitudinal crack in the pipe.

                            Three schools dismissed early Wednesday after the second water main break this week in Stokes County. Interim town manager Marty Stevens said crews couldn't explain what caused the initial leak. When they removed the 8-inch plastic pipe they found it had a long crack that was several feet long.
